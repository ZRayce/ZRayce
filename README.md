<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    Hey! I’m <strong>Rayce</strong> 🎧🟣 — a curious BSIT 1st year student who loves coding, web & app development 💻, cybersecurity 🛡️, AI/ML 🤖, game development 🎮, and (soon) law studies ⚖️. When I’m not tinkering with tech, you’ll find me gaming 🎮, drawing as a beginner artist 🎨, learning languages 🌏 (Russian, German, French, Japanese, Chinese, Korean), sleeping 😴, or enjoying all kinds of food 🍕🍔. Fun fact: I once tried playing the violin the other way round — the violin as the bow, the bow as the violin. Trust me, don’t ask why 😂  
<br><br>
<em>“Learning everything, fearing nothing.”</em> — that’s my motto as I explore, create, and leave a spark even in the shadows.
